# mdbook via nix!

[Nix](https://nixos.org/) as a development environment is truely fantastic. Perfectly reproduceable, and gone are are the "run this script" setup steps.

This webpage is generated by [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook), but even further so the environment is a [nix flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes), so the setup is really trivial.

## Configuration

This is the flake.nix which makes it all happen:
```nix
{
  description = "Badflyer.com";
  nixConfig.bash-prompt = "\[nix-badflyer-shell\]$ ";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs";
    flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils }:
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:
      let 
        pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
        inputs = [
          pkgs.mdbook
          pkgs.git
        ];

        builder = pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
          name = "badflyer";
          src = ./.;
          buildInputs = inputs;
          buildPhase = ''
            mdbook build
          '';
          installPhase = ''
            mkdir $out
            cp -R book/* $out
          '';
        };

      in {
        devShell = pkgs.mkShell {
          buildInputs = inputs;
          };

        packages.default = builder;
        defaultPackage = builder;
        checks.default = builder;
      });
}
```

The build workflow is as simple as:
```bash
git add -all && nix build
```

The development workflow is as simple as:
```bash
nix develop
mdbook serve
```

## Deployment

This is a github pages site. Unfortunatly the free github runners don't have any nix support. So how does it get deployed? The Magic is in `git subtree split`, which allow you to commit a folder into the root of a different branch.

```yaml
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Install mdbook
        run: |
          mkdir bin
          # Download mdbook
          curl -sSL https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/releases/download/v0.4.18/mdbook-v0.4.18-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz | tar -xz --directory=bin
          # build the site
          bin/mdbook build
          # Specific to github, make sure the cname file ends up in the deployment. For the custom domain name.
          cp CNAME book/CNAME

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Deployment
        run: |
          git config --global user.email "gh-deploy@github.com"
          git config --global user.name "Continuous Integration"
          # Force add the book folder (this is the output of mdbook build)
          git add book -f
          # Commit (this will go onto master, but it's fine, we're throwing it away.)
          git commit -m "Updating"
          # Commit the 'book' folde onto the branch gh-pages
          git subtree split -P book -b gh-pages
          # Force push gh-pages
          git push --force origin gh-pages
```
